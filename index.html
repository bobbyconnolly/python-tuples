    <h1>Introduction to Tuples in Python</h1>
    
    <p>If you're familiar with lists in Python, you're already halfway to understanding tuples! Tuples are very similar to lists, but with a few key differences. Let's explore tuples and see how they relate to the lists you already know.</p>

    <h2>What is a Tuple?</h2>
    <p>A tuple is an ordered collection of items, just like a list. The main difference is that tuples use parentheses () instead of square brackets [].</p>

    <h2>Creating Tuples</h2>
    <p>Here's how you can create a tuple:</p>
    <pre><code>my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# You can also create a tuple without parentheses
another_tuple = 'a', 'b', 'c'
print(another_tuple)  # Output: ('a', 'b', 'c')</code></pre>

    <h2>Accessing Tuple Elements</h2>
    <p>You can access tuple elements just like you do with lists, using indexing:</p>
    <pre><code>my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 10
print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: 30
print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: 50 (last element)</code></pre>

    <h2>Slicing Tuples</h2>
    <p>Slicing works the same way as with lists:</p>
    <pre><code>my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
print(my_tuple[2:5])  # Output: (3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple[:3])   # Output: (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple[7:])   # Output: (8, 9, 10)</code></pre>

    <h2>Tuple Packing and Unpacking</h2>
    <p>You can pack multiple values into a tuple and unpack them into separate variables:</p>
    <pre><code># Packing
coordinates = (3, 4)

# Unpacking
x, y = coordinates
print(x)  # Output: 3
print(y)  # Output: 4</code></pre>

    <h2>Using Tuples in Functions</h2>
    <p>Tuples are great for returning multiple values from a function:</p>
    <pre><code>def get_dimensions():
    return (1920, 1080)

width, height = get_dimensions()
print(f"Width: {width}, Height: {height}")
# Output: Width: 1920, Height: 1080</code></pre>

    <h2>Tuples vs Lists</h2>
    <p>While tuples and lists are similar, there are some key differences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tuples use parentheses (), lists use square brackets []</li>
        <li>Tuples are immutable (can't be changed after creation)</li>
        <li>Tuples are often used for heterogeneous data, lists for homogeneous data</li>
        <li>Tuples can be used as dictionary keys, lists cannot</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Tuples will appear in the practice midterm and may be included in the actual midterm exam. Make sure you're comfortable with creating tuples, accessing their elements, and unpacking them.
    </div>

    <p>By understanding tuples, you're adding another powerful tool to your Python toolkit. Keep practicing, and you'll find that tuples can be very useful in many programming scenarios!</p>
